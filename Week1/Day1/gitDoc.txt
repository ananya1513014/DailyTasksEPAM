GIT:
Git is a distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.
It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files.
Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

GIT COMMANDS:

1. git init: create a new local repository.

2. git clone: creates a working cope of a local repository or a remote server.

3. git add: Adds one or more files to the index.

4. git commit: commit changes to head but not to remote repository.
	git commit -m "commit message"
	git commit -a	: Commit any files added with git add, and also commit any files changed since then:

5. git push: sends  changes to master branch of remote repository.

6. git status: lists the files that  are changed and still needs to be added or committed.

7. git grep "foo()": Search the working directory for foo().

8. git checkout -- <filename>: If you mess up, you can replace the changes in your working tree with the last content in head:

Changes already added to the index, as well as new files, will be kept.

9. git log: lists the changes in the source code

10. git tag 1.0.0 <commitID>:  can use tagging to mark a significant changeset, such as a release
